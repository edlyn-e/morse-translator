## Project: Morse Code Translator

### Overview

Project: Morse Code Translator aims to create an application that translates between English and Morse Code. For this project, the goal is to create a functional translator that is capable of translating English text into Morse Code with proper formatting (i.e. one space between each character and separation of words represented by a slash (/) or a pipe ( | ) as per the guidelines <a href = "https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html" >here</a>. The aim of this project is to apply learned and accumulated knowledge and further build upon my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

### Goals

-   Create a functioning translator that accurately translates between English and Morse Code and vice versa.

## Criteria

-   Create a user interface that allows the user to input English or Morse Code
-   Create JavaScript functions that allows the user to:
    -   translate English to Morse Code
    -   translate Morse Code into English
-   JavaScript functions should also:
    -   handle spaces properly: 1 space between English _words_, but 1 space between Morse Code _characters_
    -   keep pure functions separated from the DOM interaction code

## The to-do list plan

In this section, I break down the project into smaller and manageable tasks to establish metrics to measure my progress on this project. I have also sketched out some ideas to help flesh out the process a little more.
